# Kirev-Kingdoms-Revolt
 A game demo inspired by [Antiyoy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yio.tro.antiyoy.android&hl=en)

The game currently features:
- A grid based game world, where every same colored connecting tile is part of the same group (Currently used for selection but will have a lot of uses for planned features)
- A smooth game camera that feels good and intuitive.
- Debug ui
